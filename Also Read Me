Seriously though, this is something that is meant to look like a virus. a very shit one to say the least.

Why?
i made it a while ago for an IT assignment for high school to proove that i could make a simple window in visual basic.
i thaught it would be funny to make a dumb looking, fake virus, so i did it.

What is it?
a fake virus in visual basic. it serves no purpose other than to be hella gooft
